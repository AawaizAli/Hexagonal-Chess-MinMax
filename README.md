## Usage

To run the Min-Max solver, run the `Main.py` file. In this file, you'll also be able to select which of the 12 puzzles you'd like the agent to solve.

## Algorithms

### Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

The Min-Max algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory. Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Min-Max algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
